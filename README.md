# C - Binary trees

## Overview
This repository provides an introduction to binary trees, a fundamental __data structure__ in computer science.
Binary trees are hierarchical structures composed of nodes, each having at most two children: a __left child__ and a __right child__

## Features
1. Introduction to basic binary tree concepts
2. Implementation of binary tree data structure
3. Examples of binary search trees (BST)
4. Traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
5. Balanced binary trees (e.g., AVL trees)
6. Binary tree applications, such as expression trees and sorting
